# Plan-and-Execute Agent Policy List
#
# These policies are specific to the plan-and-execute agent example. They ensure
# the graph properly handles plan execution, replanning, and response generation
# with quality control, error handling, and resource management.
#
# IMPORTANT: This workflow maintains the original notebook logic - node functions
# do NOT calculate quality metrics. Policies independently monitor and can:
# 1. Alert-only: Log warnings without blocking execution
# 2. Routing: Trigger flow redirection without modifying node code
#
# Policy Categories:
# 1. Alert-only checkers: Monitor and alert on issues (defined in custom_policy.py)
# 2. Routing policies: Can redirect flow but don't modify node code (defined in custom_policy.py)
# 3. Graph structure checkers: Validate workflow structure (defined in custom_policy.py)
#
# All policies are now defined in custom_policy.py because they need to:
# - Calculate metrics independently (not from node functions)
# - Support alert-only mode (no blocking)
# - Support routing mode (flow redirection only)
#
# Kernel-level policies remain unchanged.

# Note: This YAML file is kept for reference, but all policies are now
# defined in custom_policy.py to support independent metric calculation
# and alert-only/routing modes.
